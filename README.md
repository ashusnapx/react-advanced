## Getting Started

Let's start our journey by setting up the development environment and understanding the basic concepts of React.

### Setting Up Development Environment

Follow these steps to set up your development environment for React.

1. Install Node.js and npm.
2. Install create-react-app globally.
3. Create your first React app.

```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app my-first-react-app
```

### Understanding JSX

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
}

export default App;
```

## Core Concepts

In this section, we'll cover the core concepts that form the foundation of React.

### Components and Props

Learn about React components and how to pass data through props.

```jsx
// Define a functional component
function Greeting(props) {
  return <p>Hello, {props.name}!</p>;
}

// Use the component with props
<Greeting name="John" />
```

### State and Lifecycle

Understand how to manage state and work with component lifecycles.

```jsx
class Timer extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { seconds: 0 };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.interval = setInterval(() => {
      this.setState({ seconds: this.state.seconds + 1 });
    }, 1000);
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.interval);
  }

  render() {
    return <p>Seconds: {this.state.seconds}</p>;
  }
}
```

## Intermediate Techniques

In this section, we'll dive deeper into more advanced concepts and techniques.

### Hooks

Explore React Hooks, which provide a way to use state and lifecycle features without writing classes.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Context

Learn about React's Context API for managing global state in your application.

```jsx
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
      <Toolbar />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}
```

## Advanced Topics

This section will cover super advanced topics that will take your React skills to the next level.

### Render Props

Master the technique of using a prop to control what is rendered in a component.

```jsx
class Mouse extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div onMouseMove={this.props.handleMouseMove}>
        {/* Render something based on mouse position */}
      </div>
    );
  }
}

class App extends React.Component {
  handleMouseMove(event) {
    // Handle mouse movement
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Move the mouse!</h1>
        <Mouse handleMouseMove={this.handleMouseMove} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

### Custom Hooks

Create custom hooks to encapsulate and reuse stateful logic.

```jsx
function useLocalStorage(key, initialValue) {
  // Custom hook logic to manage local storage
}

function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useLocalStorage('name', 'Guest');
  // ...
}
```

## Real-world Projects

Apply your React knowledge to real-world projects that showcase your skills.

### E-commerce Website

Build a fully functional e-commerce website using React, Redux, and a backend API.

### Task Management App

Create a task management app with features like adding, editing, and filtering tasks.
